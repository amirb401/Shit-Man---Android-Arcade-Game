# Shit Man - the android 2D arcade game

## The Story

During Sukkot holiday of 2019, we had a funny family discussion on how there are no good games to play on the phone for when you need to go to the bathroom for long periods.

Me, a gamer by heart with the knowledge of art, design and programming deicded to take it upon my self to create a fun, yet challenging game to play. 
With the overall theme of a bathroom break, I have decided to go with the obvious name of "Shit Man".

Shit Man was created casually with breaks over the course of several months, but on the 6th of December it was removed due to "Violation of Repetitive Content policy", as the game according to Google Play team was "Merely providing the same experience as other applications already existing on the play store".

The game was **available on the Google Playstore for 13 months**, and had **76 unique downloads** from all around the world.

What started as a fun little project, became something big and unique which I have learned tremendous from and for that I cherish it as a personal favorite.

I created the whole project myself, from art, to design and testing, deploying to Google Playstore and anything else in between.

## Game Features & Road plan
1. 2D arcade like Character movement
2. Different stages with increasing difficulty according to amount of poops avoided and length of current game play.
3. Fully functioning shop with skins for your character and buffs that will help the user progress
4. Buffs included:
   - Toilet paper -> Shield. in case a player was hit by a poop, the shield was consumed and the player would be able to continue playing.
   - Poop Stick -> Causes all poops on screen to explode, acts like a "screen cleaner".
   - Newspaper -> slows down time for everything but the player. (Buffs and poop spawns are moving slowly for a short period of time).
   - Big coin -> 10x the worth of a single coin.
5. Achievement progression -> different achievements including # of buffs collected, # of skins, # of poops touched, longest duration played
